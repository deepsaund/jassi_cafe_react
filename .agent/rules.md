# Agent Rules

- **GitHub Pushing**: Always push changes to the GitHub repository (`https://github.com/deepsaund/jassi_cafe_react.git`) after completing a task or making significant changes.
- **Commit Messages**: Use concise and descriptive commit messages for all auto-commits.
- **Branch**: Always use the `main` branch unless otherwise specified.
- **Language**: Use simple, clear, and non-technical language. Avoid sci-fi or developer jargon (e.g., "Node", "Neural", "Matrix", "Protocol", "Sync", "Artifacts") unless specifically requested. The target audience is non-developers.

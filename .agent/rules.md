# Agent Rules

- **GitHub Pushing**: Always push changes to the GitHub repository (`https://github.com/deepsaund/jassi_cafe_react.git`) after completing a task or making significant changes.
- **Commit Messages**: Use concise and descriptive commit messages for all auto-commits.
- **Branch**: Always use the `main` branch unless otherwise specified.
- **Language**: Use simple, clear, and non-technical language. Avoid technical or developer jargon unless specifically requested. The target audience is non-developers.
- **Read the Rules First**: You MUST read the `.agent/rules.md` file at the start of EVERY task before writing any code.
- **Mandatory Pagination**: Never allow tables or lists to grow indefinitely. Always implement pagination (max 5-10 items per page) to keep the UI clean.
- **Visual Design**: prioritize a minimalist, premium design with dark mode support. Every button and card should have subtle hover animations.
